Problem Statement :

Context:
There are times when AWS makes changes to services or when there has been some issue with the services or some update then a notification is shared with AWS customer letting them know their affected resources
which needs attention or updation where cx are provided with affected resources.

Sept 2024, AWS has asked cutomers to update all of their IAM policies where action ssm:StartSession was specified, the update asks to include "...document/SSM-SessionManagerRunShell" in the resource section which
are now required to start interactive shell sessions.  

=========
Problem:
=========
AWS not always provide every affected resource but only sample therefore its overwhelming to list down all polcicies containing this action and not the resource section which is asked.

============
Solution
============
Scans all your IAM users and checks for each type of policy i.e customer managed, inline policy and check for action "ssm:StartSession”. 

=================
Policies_with_actions.py
=================
List down all policies with "ssm:StartSession" action present in it

===================
Policies_with_action_not_met_condition.py
===================

List down all policies with "ssm:StartSession" present in it but no resource containing the string “SSM-SessionManagerRunShell”.
